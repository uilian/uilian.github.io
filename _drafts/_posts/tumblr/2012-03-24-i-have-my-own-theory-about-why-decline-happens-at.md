title: I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies, they make some
  great products, but then the sales and marketing people take over the company, because
  they are the ones who can juice up profits. When the sales guys run the company,
  the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened
  at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault, and it happened when Ballmer
  took over at Microsoft.
